# Business Systems Developer Work Sample

Thank you for taking time to consider working at Compose.  This is a work sample to help us kick off the relationship.  We find starting with this process removes the uneasy feelings that resum√©s give us.

This should take around 5 - 6 hours.  Don't sweat if this takes longer.  While we provide a time, we respect quality work far more than an immediate response.  Thus, we put this timeframe on the project to be upfront with you.  But, the time should not restrict you.

## The work samples

Distributed billing systems are an interesting beast. We are looking for someone who can work through the logical process of simplifying complexity into a system that other people will find easy to use.  The following tasks are part of the work samples:

1. System design
2. API programming
3. Reports

The tasks will be based on the assets in the following files:

* `api-calls.sh`, which can be run with `sh api-calls.sh $HOSTNAME` where `$HOSTNAME` is equal to an API you will create in step 2.
* `generator.rb` is a file we used to generate the `api-calls.sh`.  It can be used to generate a new set of API commands to test an API edge cases, but it is not required.

## 1. System design

Investigate the calls we are making in `api-calls.sh`.  Describe priorities and assumptions you will make for a system that would solve for these inputs (you will also want to read the 2 following tasks understand what you are designing).

## 2. API programming

Build a system which takes accepts the calls `api-calls.sh`.

## 3. Reports

Build a UI that shows the following:

* overall view of revenue for a month
* breakdown of revenue per customer for a month
* breakdown of revenue per product for a month

## Words of encouragement

The `api-calls.sh` is purposefully left open ended.  Compose team members worked through the work sample to ensure we understand what we are asking of you.  If you stop, start, change directions, and change iterations, we want to see those modifications and thought process.  Please use a git repository so that we can see how your thought process evolved during the project.

We are looking forward to hearing from you!
