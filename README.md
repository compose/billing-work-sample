# Billing Engineer Work Sample

Thank you for taking time to consider working at Compose.  This is a work sample to help us kick off the relationship.  We find starting with this process removes the uneasy feelings that resum√©s give us.

This should take around 3 - 4 hours for a typical engineer.  Don't sweat if this takes longer.  While we say 3 - 4 hours, we respect quality work far more than an immediate response.  Thus, we put this timeframe on the project to be upfront with you more than to restrict you.

# The work samples

Because billing is an interesting beast, we are looking for a variety of skills.  The following tasks are part of the work samples:

1. API programming
2. Data presentation
3. Report generation

## API programming

We have created a series of cURL commands at [curl comands].  These cURL commands are not vanilla, best-case commands.  They are the types of commands that you would expect from a distributed system.

Build your API, then run this against them, where host and port are the host port for your local endpoint:

```
./api-calls.sh {host}:{port}
```
